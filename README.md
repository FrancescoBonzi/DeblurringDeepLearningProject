# DeblurringDeepLearningProject

To run the REDs part of the project the user has to create a new file called REDs_directories.py in the root folder with the absolute paths of the REDs dataset.
The variables to rename are the following:

train_blurred_videos_directory = ""
train_sharped_videos_directory = ""
test_blurred_videos_directory = ""
test_sharped_videos_directory = ""
